# Southwest Airlines Innovation Challenge

Take-home project for prospective Innovation team members

Overview
--------------------------
We are a team within Southwest Airlines that uses technology in creative ways to support the use cases defined by our Corporate Strategy team. For example, if they come to us with a need for sending information between multiple teams in an airport, we might create a proof of concept mobile app that can be used on watches and tablets. We start with a proof of concept, and with testing and approval move it into a pilot phase. If accepted, we can then work on hardening and launching the implementation across our entire workforce.

Our mission requires us to keep abreast of all technologies - mobile, augmented reality, exoskeletons, IOT...to name a few.

Criteria
--------------------------
This challenge is designed to be relatively simple but open-ended. We are looking to see the creativity you bring to accomplishing the straight-forward implementation of a basic mobile application. This is your opportunity to show us how an app needs to be done.

We know that your time is important, so we’ve designed the challenge with that in mind. An acceptable solution might take between 4-8 hours depending on how familiar you are with the development platform. Nevertheless, please feel free to use as much of the alotted time window as you’d like crafting your preferred solution. We hope you have fun building it!

Requirements
--------------------------
1. Use the following api as a data feed for your application: [randomuser api] (https://randomuser.me/documentation)
2. For the main screen, display a list of users from the randomuser api above
3. The list should support pull to refresh
4. Display any information from the feed that you think is intuitive - be creative!
5. Selecting an item should take you to a user's profile detail screen, which further displays information from the randomuser record (take advantage of the user data and geodata information) - again, be creative!
6. Include instructions for building the application and any relevant documentation in a README.md file

Other Notes
--------------------------
This code will be code reviewed by our team, so please clean it up, add commenting where appropriate, and thoroughly test it before submitting it.

You can add any third party libraries you need - please make sure there is proper documentation for a link back to the main repositories included in the README.md file.

Considerations
--------------------------
We aim to create fast and quality app experiences. Among other criteria, your submission will be evaluated on:

1. Implementation of the stated requirements
2. Application Architecture
3. The general quality of the code and its resistance to crashing
4. Your use of coding conventions
5. Knowledge and usage of libraries and sdk’s
6. Clarity of communications in comments and other documentation
7. UI and UX -- while you don’t have to spend any time creating assets, the app should look clean and generally obey the platform's Human Interface Guidelines

When You're Done
--------------------------
Create a github repository, and send it to us. We will download, compile and evaluate it, and send you feedback when our assesment is complete. We are looking for to seeing what you come up with.

Thank you for participating!
